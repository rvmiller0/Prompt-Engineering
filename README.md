# Prompt-Engineering
Assignment 3 for CSCI 420

We used different AI models to solve 20 programming problems, using 2 different prompting strategies and 2 different models for each problem. This resulted in a collection of 80 inputs and outputs, which we used to compare different models and prompting strategies.

Our chat logs can be found in `Problems_Explored.csv`. Prompting code for each of the problems can be found in `even_prompts.ipynb` and `odd_prompts.ipynb`. Our analysis of the different models and prompting strategies can be found in `Prompt_Engineering_Report.pdf`.
