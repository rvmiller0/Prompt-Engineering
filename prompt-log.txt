Problem 1:

GPT-4, Zero-shot:
Summarize the functionality of the following Java method:
public Map < String , Integer > countWordFrequency ( List < String > words ) {
    Map < String , Integer > freqMap = new HashMap < >() ;
    for ( String word : words ) {
        freqMap . put ( word , freqMap . getOrDefault ( word , 0) + 1) ;
    }
    return freqMap ;
}


The provided method `find_primes(n)` calculates and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to the given integer `n`. Here is a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Initialization**: It starts with an empty list, `primes`, to store the identified prime numbers.

2. **Main Loop**: It iterates through numbers `num` from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Prime Check**: For each number `num`, it checks if `num` is divisible by any of the already identified prime numbers in the `primes` list. This is done using a generator expression in `all(num % p != 0 for p in primes)`.
   - If `all` returns `True` (i.e., `num` is not divisible by any primes), then `num` is a prime number.

4. **Add to Primes**: If `num` is a prime number, it is added to the `primes` list.

5. **Return Result**: After completing the loop, the method returns the list of prime numbers.

### Summary
The method uses a dynamic list (`primes`) and iteratively builds it by testing divisibility of each number up to `n` to determine if it is prime. This approach is a basic implementation of finding primes with no explicit optimizations like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
